# About Me


I'm a guy, who was professionally schooled and taught in Milling as well as Turning
Metal. My first interest for programming/development came up as I was in my 2nd year and began to learn
programming CNC Machines using G-Code based on PAL.


As of today I am very interested in all kinds of automation using either tools that were build by others
or build by myself.
